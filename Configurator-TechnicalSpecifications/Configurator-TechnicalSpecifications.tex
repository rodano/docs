\section{Introduction}
KVConfig is a Javascript application that allows to configure with ease all aspects of a clinical study built with KV. KVConfig can run in two different modes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stand-alone, used to create a new study.
	\item Hosted by a KV server, used to edit an existing configuration.
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional requirements}
